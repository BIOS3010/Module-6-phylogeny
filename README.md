# Module 6 - Phylogeny

The purpose of these exercises is to show you of some ways to construct phylogenetic trees based on _multiple sequence alignments (MSA)_ which you already should master. To construct the phylogenetic trees we will use http://www.phylogeny.fr/ , a simple online solution suitable for relatively small phylogenetic analyses. For more complex situations with several hundred taxa and/or genes it is common to use a computer cluster for the calculations since they can be computationally very demanding. A computing cluster will be used later in the course, but for this exercise the web resource will be sufficient.

For visualization we will use FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Online visualization tools also exists  but FigTree gives you some more flexibility.
